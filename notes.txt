BCRYPT

<------------------------------------>

Hash 
    > fingerprint of original data (always unique)
    > data is fed into an algorithm, which returns a fixed length result

Salt
    > adding random data to original data before hashing process

BCrypt hash structure
    > [hash algorithm][cost][22 characters of salt in plaintext][hashed password]

Cost 
    > amount of power it takes to compute the hash
    > logarithmic scale of 2^cost - determines how many times the 
      data has been through the hashing algorithm
    > cost of 10 - hashes 10 passwords per second on an average computer
    > cost of 15 - takes 3 seconds per hash
    > at this time a cost of 12 is considered very secure
